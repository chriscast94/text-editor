# text-editor

## Description
This app is a Progressive Web Application that uses data persistance techniques. This app was created to create notes or snippets with or without an internet connection and be able to reliably retrieve them for later use.

This project was very challenging but great hands on practice setting up a PWA Application. I was able to practice implementing methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database, something that I had struggled with in the past, gaining a better understanding now.

Likewise, routing has been a consistent challenge for me, and this project was no excpetion. However, just like with storing and getting data from the database, consistent work and debugging has helped me greatly.
